    Graphical representation of an object which is, in fact, a regular matrix
    that is a collection of a reflectance values. The reflectance values are
    usually measured by sensors of a specific range of light wavelengths;
    examples of these sensors are those aerial­transported such are aircrafts or
    satellites or those integrated in a scanner used to digitalize printed
    documents.
