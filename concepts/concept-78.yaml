    Geometric reference system used to numerically express the geodesic position
    of a point over the terrain. Each datum is defined according of an ellipsoid
    and a point where the ellipsoid and the Earth are tangent. In Spain for
    example, the datum uses the Hayford (or International 1924) ellipsoid and
    the tangency point is Postdam (Germany).
