    A set or group of geospatial data with a common theme or association.
    Geospatial datasets are often represented in a GIS by a thematic layer.
    Geospatial datasets are typically the main elements in a GIS Data Model.
     Example: An ESRI Shapefile with a set of line features representing city streets could be called a Geospatial data set.

      dataset

      identifiable collection of data;

      Note 1 to entry:  A dataset can be a smaller grouping of data which,
      though limited by some constraint such as spatial extent or feature type,
      is located physically within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset
      can be as small as a single feature or feature attribute contained within
      a larger dataset. A hardcopy map or chart can be considered a dataset.;
