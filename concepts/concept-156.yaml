    Is the level surface, equipotential in the gravitational field, which adopts
    an irregular three­dimensional spheroid. Due to the dependency on the mass
    distribution inside the Earth, it is impossible to represent it
    mathematically. The mathematical shape used to do it is the ellipsoid that
    approximately fits better the Earth shape. The geoid is coincident with the
    mean ocean surface when they are quiet, virtually extended for the
    continents land.
