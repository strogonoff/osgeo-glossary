    A published GeoServer representation of a collection of vector feature types
    (featureType) stored as mathematical paths—a point as a single x, y
    coordinate, lines as a series of x, y coordinates, and polygons as a series
    of x, y coordinates that start and end on the same location. See also Layer.
