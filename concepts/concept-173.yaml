    Graphic Interchange Format. Developed by CompuServe to provide a standard
    and platform­independent format. The GIF format is limited to a maximum of
    256 colours. It is a reasonable limitation since most of the PC screens
    support 256 colours at most. In general, GIF is recommended for simple
    images. When the background has textures they are not useful because the
    computer tries to find the closest colour, and some distortions may appear
    in this process and the result is an inaccurate displaying for the image.
