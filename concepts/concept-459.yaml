    Well-Known Text. This refers either to the text representation of
    geometries, with strings starting “POINT”, “LINESTRING”, “POLYGON”, and so
    on, or the text representation of a CRS, with strings starting “PROJCS”,
    “GEOGCS”, and so on. Well-known text representations are OGC standards, but
    do not have their own specification documents. The first descriptions of
    Well-Known Text (for geometries and for CRS) appeared in the SFSQL 1.0
    specification. Often abbreviated as WKT.
