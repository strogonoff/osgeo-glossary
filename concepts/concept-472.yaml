    The Web Processing Service (WPS) specification from the Open Geospatial
    Consortium provides rules for standardizing inputs and outputs (requests and
    responses) for geospatial processing services. The Web Processing Service is
    designed to standardize the way that GIS calculations are made available to
    the Internet. WPS can describe any calculation (i.e. process) including all
    of its inputs and outputs, and trigger its execution as a Web Service.
