    Coordinate reference system. The combination of a geographic and projected
    coordinate systems that define how two-dimensional maps relate to locations
    on the earth’s surface. Geographic coordinate systems use a
    three-dimensional spherical surface to define those locations, referencing
    points on that surface through angles (latitude and longitude values)
    measured from the earth’s center. Projected coordinate systems are based on
    flat two-dimensional surfaces, with locations referenced by x, y coordinates
    measured as constant lengths and distances across that surface. See also
    SRID and SRS.

      coordinate reference system

      coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum


      Note 1 to entry: Geodetic and vertical datums are referred to as reference
      frames.


      Note 2 to entry: For geodetic and vertical reference frames, the object
      will be the Earth. In planetary applications, geodetic and vertical
      reference frames may be applied to other celestial bodies.
