    Set of data structured in order to enable the storage, consultation and
    upgrading in a computer system. The relational database is a concrete case
    in which the information is organized in relations (often known as
    “tables”). Relations are a set of tuples (“records”) and a tuple integrates
    information about an element in a set of fields (one field for each
    attribute of the element); if two tables share a field containing values
    within the same domain then it is possible to apply a union operation. The
    union links the tuples according on the values in the linking field.
