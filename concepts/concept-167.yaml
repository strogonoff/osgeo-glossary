    A single and specific metadata document, typically created in conformance
    with a metadata standard. There is typically a metadata instance for each
    geospatial dataset in a GIS. 
     Example: If you had a GIS that managed road data and car accident data in ESRI Shapefiles, you would have a metadata instance for each shapefile. One metadata instance might be named roads_metadata.txt while the other was named car_accidents_metadata.txt.
