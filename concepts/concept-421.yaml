    A tileindex is a Shapefile or other Vector data source that contains
    footprints of Raster data coverage. MapServer can use a tileindex to render
    a directory of raster data. The tileindex allows MapServer to only read the
    data that intersects the requested map extent, rather than reading all of
    the data.
