    EPSG codes are numeric codes associated with coordinate system definitions.
    For instance, EPSG:4326 is geographic WGS84, and EPSG:32611 is “UTM zone 11
    North, WGS84”. The WMS protocol uses EPSG codes to describe coordinate
    systems. EPSG codes are published by the OGP Surveying and Positioning
    Committee. A list of PROJ definitions corresponding to the EPSG codes can be
    found in the file /usr/local/share/proj/epsg. PROJECTION describes how to
    use these in your Mapfile.
